# Senior Project
[LEAP Online](/img/projects/leap_online.jpg)
Sandwiched in between development of the BOSS and CEC systems is my senior capstone project: the Learning Environment and Activity Portal (LEAP).  Its purpose was to remotely connect math on-campus tutors with rural students across Eastern Washington.

This project is significant because it is the first somewhat large-scale project that I have completed as part of a team.  Luckily, my team was comprised of people who I liked and generally got along with.  But, that's not to say there wasn't a high-tension fight or two.  
At the end of the term, we presented our project to the CS faculty, alumni, and students.  Our project was easily one of the top three best projects.   

LEAP Online runs on the same server as the Civic Engagement Center's website: a custom-build Linux machine running Apache 2.2.3, PHP 5.2, and MySQL 5.0.
