# OSBLE

From the [Help Lab](http://helplab.org/Projects/OSBLE) website:
For the past decade, we have been exploring the potential for the studio-based learning (SBL) approach commonly used in architecture and fine arts education to be adapted for computing education. To support SBL, we have been developing the Online Studio-Based Learning Environment (OSBLE), a lightweight course management system with powerful and flexible features to support SBL, including team assignments, iterative peer review, and peer review assessment.

I started working on OSBLE at about the same time that I started to work on ChemProV in 2009.  As OSBLE started to become Help Lab's all-encompasing research project, I started to spend more time on OSBLE and less on ChemProV.  OSBLE began its humble life as a system to support asynchronous code reviews and walkthroughs and eventually ballooned into a full-fledged course management system comparable to Blackboard or Canvas.

Between 2009 and 2013, I was involved in nearly every major feature introduced into the system.  Key contributions include:

* Developing a web API for user authentication, and 3rd party service integration
* Developed a "Turbo Tax"-like wizard for creating new assignments
* Developed an assignment dashboard for displaying key aspects of an assignment and students' submission progress
* Developed a file manager for sharing files in OSBIDE
* Developed class-specific activity feeds for students to pose questions to the class
