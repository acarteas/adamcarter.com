From the [Help Lab](http://helplab.org/Projects/OSBLE) website:
For the past decade, we have been exploring the potential for the studio-based learning (SBL) approach commonly used in architecture and fine arts education to be adapted for computing education. To support SBL, we have been developing the Online Studio-Based Learning Environment (OSBLE), a lightweight course management system with powerful and flexible features to support SBL, including team assignments, iterative peer review, and peer review assessment.

As OSBLE started to become Help Lab's all-encompasing research project, I began spending more and more of my time on OSBLE and less of my time on ChemProV.  OSBLE began its humble life as a system to support asynchronous code reviews and walkthroughs and eventually ballooned into a full-fledged course management system comparable to Blackboard or Canvas.




OSBLE Versions 1 and 2 were written in ASP.NET Webforms
OSBLE Versions 3+ were written in increasing versions of ASP.NET MVC
