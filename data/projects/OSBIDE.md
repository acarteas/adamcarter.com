# OSBIDE
[OSBLE](/img/projects/osbide.jpg)
OSBIDE was my PhD project.  It incorporates social networking and data logging features into Microsoft Visual Studio 2013+.  Its purpose of this was twofold.  First, it was to promote better social connections among students as feeling disconnected is one of the primary reasons why student leave computer science.  Second, we we wanted to see if we could use student activity within the IDE to predict classroom success (i.e. grades).  OSBIDE was successful in both cases. 

Students that used OSBIDE during the semester were statistically more likely to see an improvement in their sense of classroom community.  Control conditions that did not use OSBIDE did not demonstrate any statistical improvement.

The data collected through OSBIDE allowed us to construct the Programming State Model (PSM).  The PSM attempts to describe programming behaviors along a two dimensional axis of syntactic (compile time) and semantic (run time) correctness.  Statistical regression found that the PSM was able to predict student success with a relatively high degree of accuracy (r^2 was around .6).  

As a PhD project should, OSBIDE taught me quite a lot.  It represents a high watermark in terms of technical achievement.  OSBIDE consisted of both client and sever technologies and I learned a lot in trying to get the two to efficiently communicate.  I also learned a lot about how to analyze and segment large data sets.  Lastly, I learned a lot about how to conduct and report on research.  While I no longer work on OSBIDE, the ideas and findings that came out of the project continue to inspire grant proposals and future research.
