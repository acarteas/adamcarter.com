# Technology Service Request System
[TSR System](/img/projects/cec.jpg)
With BOSS' cancellation, I was then assigned to create a new technology service request (TSR) system for the BSD.  At the time, the BSD was using a simple, HTML-based solution intended as a "quick fix" while the "real" system (not mine) was being built.  Unfortunately, the real system was more than a year late, and with the recent personnel shakeups, it was obvious that the real system would never ship.  
When I entered the scene, the new TSR system was little more than a prototype written in Adobe Flex 2.0 (now Flash Builder).  Prior to this project, I had never used Flex.  I debated whether or not to transition to normal HTML, but in the end, I decided that this project would make a great learning experience.

Since I had just started graduate school at Washington State University, the project's development pace was quite slow.  I typically spent under five hour per week working on the system.  In spite of the slow pace, I was able to churn out a working beta by March 2008, and in May 2008, we released the first version.  Since this time, I've continued to refine and tweak the base product.
