# WOZ Pro

Having freshly graduated from CWU with my BS in Computer Science, I began my graduate tenure in 2007 at the [WSU Help Lab](http://helplab.org) working on WOZ Pro.  My undergraduate advisor had turned me on to HCI and general usability and Christopher Hundhausen, my graduate advisor, thought that WOZ Pro would be a good match for my interests.  While I really like the idea of paper prototyping, we could never really find an appropriate research angle for the software.  After spending about a year on the software, I moved to the ChemProV and OSBLE projects.

From the [Help Lab](http://helplab.org/Projects/WOZPro) website:
WOZ Pro (Wizard of Oz Prototyper) is a pen-based software environment that supports the quick and easy creation and testing of low fidelity user interface prototypes. WOZ Pro is designed to be as easy to use as pen-and-paper, but to hold key advantages over pen-and-paper and existing computer-based tools. When designing interface screens in WOZ Pro, designers can easily (a) propagate a design change to other related screens, and (b) specify the set of screens that are reachable from a given screen. In a wizard of oz test, WOZ Pro reduces the cognitive load on the wizard by allowing navigation only to those next screens that are valid.
